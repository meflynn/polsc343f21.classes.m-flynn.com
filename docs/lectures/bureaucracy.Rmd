# What Are Bureaucracies?


Executive bureaucracy before World War II

- Very small

- Creation of the Executive Office of the President (EOP) in 1939 

- Foreign policy activism spurs demand for personnel, expertise

- Senior administrators up through World War II generall had little government experience

- Bureaucracy didn't become a "career" until post-1940s

# Why Do Bureaucracies Matter?

They're responsible for a lot...

- Presidents make thousands of appointments after entering office

- Hundreds of these relate to foreign policymaking

- Direct presidential involvement varies

  - Personal taste

  - Big three: State, Defense, Treasury
  
  - Subordinates?

Power and influence
