# Historical Background



---
class: left, top

# Historical Background

Trade before 1934

- Protectionism is dominant approach to US economic development

- Northeastern manufacturing interests had substantial political influence and favor protectionist policies

- Southern and Western agricultural interests less influential and favor freer trade polices. 



---

# Historical Background

Trade after 1934

- Northeastern and Southern interests align in 1930s and 1940s

- Both groups come to support freer trade

- Protectionist barriers begin to come down

- World War II marks an important turning point

# Historical Background


Bretton Woods System

- Partly a reaction to pre-World War II move to autarky

- Three main components

  - General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
  - International Monetary Fund (IMF)
  - International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank)

# Why Does Trade Matter?





---
class: left, top

# Why Does Trade Matter?

Theoretical

- Realism/Mercantilism

  - Trade as a source of national power
  
  - Trade is a zero-sum game
  
- Liberal theory

  - Trade can be positive-sum (both/multiple players can "win")
  
  - Trade has other beneficial effects (e.g. it promotes peaceful relations between states)

# Why Does Trade Matter?

Tangible benefits

- Trade creates jobs

- Access to desirable goods (spices, cool cars, technology, media/entertainment)

Less tangible

- Soft power and prestige

- Information, education, etc.

# Trade as a Policy Instrument

# Trade as a Policy Instrument

Trade can be a source of power

- Control over vital resources

- Necessary for survival of the state, everyday life, etc.
  
- Few substitutes, few alternative suppliers

# Trade as a Policy Instrument

Market access

- Producers need markets. Scaling up production requires larger markets.

- Exports bring in money from the sale of goods

- Domestic consumer base is often limited in various ways (money, taste, interests, etc.)

- Provides bargaining power

# Trade as a Policy Instrument

Protectionism

- Trade creates winners and losers

- Some countries can produce goods more/less efficiently than others

- Domestic producers who are relatively inefficient tend to favor protectionism (i.e. government intervention)




---
class: left, top

# Trade as a Policy Instrument

Forms of Protectionism

- Trade protection can come in a variety of policy interventions

  - Tariffs: Taxes on imported goods
  
  - Quotas: Limits on how much of a good is imported
  
  - Subsidies: Government payments to purchase goods or offset costs of donig business
  
  - Health and safety regulations: Creating different standards between importers and exporters

# Trade as a Policy Instrument

Example: Sugar Quota System

- WTO agreements requires the US to import a minimum of 1,117,195 metric tons of raw sugar from global producers

- This is an aggregate figure-it does not have to be distributed evenly across sugar producing states

# Trade as a Policy Instrument


What is the benefit to foreign countries?

--

- Dominican Republic share = 185,050 metric tons

--

- World raw sugar price (2019) `\(\approx\)` 12.36 cents/lb.

--

- US raw sugar price (2019) `\(\approx\)` 26.16 cents/lb.

--

- Difference = 13.8 cents/lb.

--

So what?

--

That's about $56.3 million more than world market!

# Trade as a Policy Instrument

More recent example: Manufacturing

- Some industries are politically powerful for reasons apart from economic salience

- Manufacturing sector has a lot of influence

- Heavily tied into American image of production and the importance of making things

- Early Trump economic policies focused on "reviving" US manufacturing, but what it in need of resuscitation?

# Notes

There's really no evidence that Trump's tariffs altered the employment or wage levels/growth that we see here.

# Monetary Policy




---
class: top, left

# Monetary Policy

People need money to buy things

- Theoretically, we could use all sorts of stuff!

- A commonly held/used/accepted currency (e.g. "brand") of money helps resolve coordination problems

- US dollar is widely used and valued, making it a great basis for global commercial exchange




---
class: top, left

# Monetary Policy

So what are we talking about here?

For present purposes, let's focus on two key issue areas

- Money supply

- Exchange rates

# Monetary Policy

Mr. (money) manager

- Governments manipulate money and its value through a couple of key mechanisms

  - Setting interest rates
  
  - Buying and selling assets

--

- People use the dollar, so what?

- Well, when you print your own currency and that currency is used as a global reserve currency, you've got options!

# Immigration Policy

A Brief Overview of US Immigration Policy

- Immigration was largely unregulated until the late 1800s
- US government starts keeping track more systematically in 1819 with the Steerage Act
- Immigration Act of 1864 creates positions within the State Department to oversee immigration, but Act is repealed after 4 years.
- Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882
- Immigration Act of 1882
- Immigration Act of 1891





---
class: left, top

# Immigration Policy

Early Quote System

Immigration policy takes a turn in the 20th Century

- Quota Law of 1921
- National Origins Act of 1924



---
ckass: left, top

# Immigration Policy

Cold War Period

- Labor shortages during WWII lead to growth in immigration from Mexico
- US eliminates formal race-based quotas on immigration, but *de facto* policy still prioritizes Western Europe
- Country-specific quotas are gradually eliminated, but broad regional quotas remain
- US policy eventually starts to emphasize humanitarian concerns, partly to stick it to the Soviets

# What Drives Immigration?

class: left, top

# What Drives Immigration?

Lots of things, but for now we'll focus on a basic IPE approach to political economy

- Push Factors
    - Lack of economic opportunity (i.e. jobs)
    - War and conflict
    - Repression and violence
    - Crime
    
- Pull Factors
    - Basically the same, but the inverse
    - Attracted to job opportunities
    - Less crime/violence
    - More political participation

# What Drives Immigration?


Heckscher--Ohlin Framework

- Think of migration in terms of trade theory
- Countries *export* goods that make intensive use of the factors that are abundant
- Countries *import* goods that make intensive use of the factors that are scarce

Migration as factor mobility

-  Just as investors move capital around seeking a greater return on investment, so too do individuals move trying to find greater returns on **their** investment (i.e. time, effort, skills, etc.)
