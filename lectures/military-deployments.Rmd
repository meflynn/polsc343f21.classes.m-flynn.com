# What are military deployments?

Let's define them

> The permanent or temporary placement of military personnel and assets in a location outside of the United States and its territories.


Different types:

- Combat versus non-combat deployments

- Marine Embassy Guards/Marine Security Guard

# Why Deploy Troops?

Lots of reasons

- Balance against power/threat
- Signal credibility
- Facilitate power projection capabilities
- Crisis intervention
- Train host-state soldiers
- Field experience/training for US personnel
- Humanitarian operations
- Secure trade and investment relationships

# Why Deploy Troops?


Alliances vs. Troops: Why do states choose one over the other?

- Cheap talk

- Tying hands vs sinking costs

- Force Projection

# Effects of Military Deployments

What are the consequences of deployments?

- Security effects

- Economic effects

- Public opinion



---
class: left, top

# Effects of Military Deployments

Security Effects

- Reduced military spending (for most) and a smaller host-state military

- Effect is also context-dependent

- Some increased likelihood of conflict

# Effects of military deployments

### Economic Effects

Evidence of:

- Higher economic growth
- Higher infrastructure growth
- Higher levels of trade between US and host country
- Higher levels of FDI into host country
- Evidence of increased trade between third-party states

# Effects of military deployments


### Economic effects

So what's the causal link?

1. Deployments signal stability, prompting investment?
2. Diffusion of technology and expertise?
3. Increasing demand by increasing consumer pool?

# Effects of Troop Deployments


### Public Opinion

- Military deployments have been central to US foreign policy for 70+ years

- But what do we know about their effects on the host-state? Not much.

- Big question: What do people think of these deployments?

# Effects of Troop Deployments

Possible causal pathways to influence public opinion:

- Interpersonal or social network contacts

- Economic effects

- Negative externalities
