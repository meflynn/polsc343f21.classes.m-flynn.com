# Key Questions

1. How has the importance of trade to the US economy changed over time?

2. What is protectionism? What role has it played in the history of US development?

3. What is the difference between fiscal and monetary policy? How do they relate to one another?

4. How does an industry's size relate to its ability to get protectionist policies?

5. What are the positions of the two major parties been on trade policy? How have they changed over time?

6. What are some of the major changes in immigration policy across US history?

7. How has immigration been a tool of US foreign policy?

# Historical Background



---
class: left, top

# Historical Background

Trade before 1934

- Protectionism is dominant approach to US economic development

- Northeastern manufacturing interests had substantial political influence and favor protectionist policies

- Southern and Western agricultural interests less influential and favor freer trade polices. 



---
class: left, top

# Historical Background

Trade after 1934

- Northeastern and Southern interests align in 1930s and 1940s

- Both groups come to support freer trade

- Protectionist barriers begin to come down

- World War II marks an important turning point

# Historical Background


Bretton Woods System

- Partly a reaction to pre-World War II move to autarky

- Three main components

  - General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
  - International Monetary Fund (IMF)
  - International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank)

# Why Does Trade Matter?





---
class: left, top

# Why Does Trade Matter?

Theoretical

- Realism/Mercantilism

  - Trade as a source of national power
  
  - Trade is a zero-sum game
  
- Liberal theory

  - Trade can be positive-sum (both/multiple players can "win")
  
  - Trade has other beneficial effects (e.g. it promotes peaceful relations between states)
  
  
  
---
class: left, top

# Why Does Trade Matter?

Tangible benefits

- Trade creates jobs

- Access to desirable goods (spices, cool cars, technology, media/entertainment)

Less tangible

- Soft power and prestige

- Information, education, etc.

# Trade as a Policy Instrument




---
class: top, left

# Trade as a Policy Instrument

Trade can be a source of power

- Control over vital resources

- Necessary for survival of the state, everyday life, etc.
  
- Few substitutes, few alternative suppliers

# Trade as a Policy Instrument

Market access

- Producers need markets. Scaling up production requires larger markets.

- Exports bring in money from the sale of goods

- Domestic consumer base is often limited in various ways (money, taste, interests, etc.)

- Provides bargaining power

# Trade as a Policy Instrument

Protectionism

- Trade creates winners and losers

- Some countries can produce goods more/less efficiently than others

- Domestic producers who are relatively inefficient tend to favor protectionism (i.e. government intervention)




---
class: left, top

# Trade as a Policy Instrument

Forms of Protectionism

- Trade protection can come in a variety of policy interventions

  - Tariffs: Taxes on imported goods
  
  - Quotas: Limits on how much of a good is imported
  
  - Subsidies: Government payments to purchase goods or offset costs of donig business
  
  - Health and safety regulations: Creating different standards between importers and exporters

# Trade as a Policy Instrument


What is the benefit to foreign countries?

--

- Dominican Republic share = 185,050 metric tons

--

- World raw sugar price (2019) $\approx$ 12.36 cents/lb.

--

- US raw sugar price (2019) $\approx$ 26.16 cents/lb.

--

- Difference = 13.8 cents/lb.

--

So what?

--

That's about $56.3 million more than world market!

# Trade as a Policy Instrument

More recent example: Manufacturing

- Some industries are politically powerful for reasons apart from economic salience

- Manufacturing sector has a lot of influence

- Heavily tied into American image of production and the importance of making things

- Early Trump economic policies focused on "reviving" US manufacturing, but what it in need of resuscitation?

# Monetary Policy

People need money to buy things

- Theoretically, we could use all sorts of stuff!

- A commonly held/used/accepted currency (e.g. "brand") of money helps resolve coordination problems

- US dollar is widely used and valued, making it a great basis for global commercial exchange

# Monetary Policy

Mr. (money) manager

- Governments manipulate money and its value through a couple of key mechanisms

  - Setting interest rates
  
  - Buying and selling assets

--

- People use the dollar, so what?

- Well, when you print your own currency and that currency is used as a global reserve currency, you've got options!

- Quota Law of 1921
- National Origins Act of 1924

# Immigration Policy

Cold War Period

- Labor shortages during WWII lead to growth in immigration from Mexico
- US eliminates formal race-based quotas on immigration, but *de facto* policy still prioritizes Western Europe
- Country-specific quotas are gradually eliminated, but broad regional quotas remain
- US policy eventually starts to emphasize humanitarian concerns, partly to stick it to the Soviets

# What Drives Immigration?

Lots of things, but for now we'll focus on a basic IPE approach to political economy

- Push Factors
    - Lack of economic opportunity (i.e. jobs)
    - War and conflict
    - Repression and violence
    - Crime
    
- Pull Factors
    - Basically the same, but the inverse
    - Attracted to job opportunities
    - Less crime/violence
    - More political participation

# What Drives Immigration?


Heckscher--Ohlin Framework

- Think of migration in terms of trade theory
- Countries *export* goods that make intensive use of the factors that are abundant
- Countries *import* goods that make intensive use of the factors that are scarce

Migration as factor mobility

-  Just as investors move capital around seeking a greater return on investment, so too do individuals move trying to find greater returns on **their** investment (i.e. time, effort, skills, etc.)
