# Key Questions

1. What are the broad contours of US foreign policy over time?

2. What have been some of the key political and economic divides in each time period?

3. What elements of US foreign policy are common across time period? What changes substantially?

4. What constitutes an "empire"? 

5. How do we reconcile the process of US expansion with popular rhetoric about democracy and (more recently) human rights?

6. How does popular historical memory of these earlier time periods shape views on policy today?

# Why do we care?

1. Try to obtain a basic level of descriptive accuracy

2. Find out if reality matches our basic assumption

3. Identify, or rule out, potential causal factors

# The Basics

class: left, top

# The Basics

- US is territorially much, much smaller

- US interactions with other nations were limited

- World is a bigger place

- US had no alliances with other states until the 20th century

- Military was very small  

- Low defense expenditures

- US and global trade were very low through 1970s

- Extension of Napoleonic Wars in Europe

- British Navy blockades European continent

### War of 1812: Consequences

- Solidified America’s status

- White House was burned down and rebuilt

- Pre-war borders essentially maintained after conflict



---
class: left, top

# The Early Years

### Monroe Doctrine (1823):

- Rejected European interference in the affairs of the Western hemisphere.  

- Attempted to establish the United States as the sole power capable of intervening in the affairs of North and South American states.

- Partly a reaction to weakening European control over colonial assets in the Western hemisphere. 




---
class: left, top

# The Early Years

### Monroe Doctrine: Enforcement

- 1860s: US uses Monroe doctrine to support the overthrow of the Emperor Maximilian in Mexico.

- 1890s: Used to justify naval buildup

- 1904–1915: To justify deploying Marines to Latin America to ward off European creditors

  - Migration of US citizens, slaveowners, and slaves into Texas territory

California
  - Valuable ports for commerce with Asia

###Mexican–American War (1846–1848)

- US offered Mexico ~$35 million in cash and debt forgiveness ($800 million + in today’s dollars)

### Civil War

- North-South split very deep (slavery, economics, expansion, trade, etc)

- In reality, these are all very closely connected

- Economic interests of the North and South were fundamentally different



---

# The Early Years

### Civil War: International Dimension

- European attitudes are mixed (oppose slavery, but want weak America)

- Some British politicians supported the North, but many favored the South in an effort to keep the United States divided

- Weakened United States would pose less of a threat to British hegemony

- Independent Southern states would change dynamics of international trade in Britain’s favor
